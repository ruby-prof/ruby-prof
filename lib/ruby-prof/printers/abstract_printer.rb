          self      - The #{metric2} by this method.
          wait      - The time this method spent waiting for other threads.
          child     - The #{metric2} by this method's children.
          calls     - The number of times this method was called.
          name      - The name of the method.
          location  - The location of the method.

        The interpretation of method names is:

          * MyObject#test - An instance method "test" of the class "MyObject"
          * <Object:MyObject>#test - The <> characters indicate a method on a singleton class.
